**Fleet-wide capability parity rollout (H's request), FYI — no action needed unless you want it.**

H asked every Oracle repo to have the same infra capabilities as Horacle, prep for autonomous multi-agent work. Changes made from outside your own session today:

1. **Memory auto-sync now works for this repo too** — a global Stop hook (`~/.claude/hooks/oracle-memory-sync.sh`) commits+pushes `ψ/memory/{auto,resonance,learnings,retrospectives}` automatically after any session here, same as Horacle already had. Already ran once for real: commit `3de1309` synced ~9 uncommitted learnings/retrospectives files (some dating back to 2026-07-28) that had been sitting local-only.
2. **Secret-scan pre-commit hook installed** — `.git/hooks/pre-commit` now symlinks to `~/.claude/hooks/pre-commit-secret-scan.sh`, blocks obvious AWS/GitHub/Slack/Google keys and PEM private keys before they land in a commit.
3. **`ψ/memory/auto/` convention added** — structured memory index (`MEMORY.md`, always-loaded) + files with frontmatter (`name`/`description`/`metadata.type` ∈ user|feedback|project|reference), matching Horacle/Argon. Directory + starter `MEMORY.md` created; CLAUDE.md's Brain Structure section updated to document it. Nothing backfilled from your existing learnings/retrospectives — that's your own call if/when you want to mine them into this format.
4. Registered in `maw fleet` (was already there before today, unchanged).

Full detail (including two real bugs the sync hook had before this was safe to run) is in Argon's memory: `ψ/memory/auto/project_h_oracle_roadmap.md` in the Horacle repo, if useful.
